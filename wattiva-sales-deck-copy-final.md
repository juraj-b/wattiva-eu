# WATTIVA SALES DECK — FINAL COPY
## "Inevitable Conclusion" Structure | Leave-Behind Document
### Version: February 2025

---

## DECK OVERVIEW

**Purpose:** Leave-behind sales document that works without a presenter.

**Audience:** Energy utility executives, DSO leadership, innovation chiefs

**Test:** Can someone understand the full value proposition from headlines alone in 90 seconds?

**Total slides:** 10 (+ optional technical appendix)

---

## SLIDE 1: HOOK

### Headline:
```
Your customers own the flexibility.
We help you use it.
```

### Subhead:
```
Wattiva aggregates EVs, batteries, heat pumps, and solar 
into one virtual power plant you control.
```

### Proof line (small, bottom):
```
1,500+ households live in production. €300/year each.
```

### Footer:
```
Wattiva — DERMS for European Energy
```

### Designer notes:
- Dark background (Wattiva purple #27153C)
- Headline in white, large
- Subhead in light purple (#A958FA)
- Minimal. Let the headline breathe.

---

## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM

### Headline:
```
Price valleys are deeper. Peaks are higher.
The gap is where the money is.
```

### Big number:
```
534
hours of negative or near-zero prices
across major EU markets in 2025
```

### Supporting text:
```
As renewables scale, expect deeper valleys and higher peaks. 
That spread is worth money — if you can shift load into valleys 
and away from peaks. Your customers already own the assets to do this.
```

### Source:
```
Source: Electricity Maps "Grid in review 2025", Gridio
```

### Designer notes:
- Light background (#F5EAFE)
- "534" as massive number (72pt+), purple (#8C21F8)
- Body text left-aligned, clean

---

## SLIDE 3: THE OPPORTUNITY

### Headline:
```
€300 per household. Already in your network.
```

### Big numbers (three columns):
```
€300/year          10-20 kW           €30M
per household      steerable load     per 100K households
proven today       per household      conservative estimate
```

### Supporting text:
```
In mature markets like the Netherlands, leading aggregators 
see €500-1,000+ per household. The value is real and growing.
```

### Source:
```
Source: Wattiva deployment data
```

### Designer notes:
- Three-column stat layout
- €300 should be the visual anchor
- Light background

---

## SLIDE 4: THE ECONOMICS

### Headline:
```
3× margin. 30% lower customer price. Both at once.
```

### Visual concept:
```
Traditional MWh          Flexible MWh
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━          ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1× margin                3× margin
Standard price           30% lower price
                         
                         ↑ Better for you
                         ↑ Better for customer
```

### Supporting text:
```
A flexible MWh sells at roughly 3× the margin of a traditional MWh. 
And you can offer it to customers at 30% lower price than standard rates.
Better margins for you. Lower bills for them.
```

### Designer notes:
- Simple side-by-side comparison
- Avoid complex charts
- The "3×" should be visually prominent

---

## SLIDE 5: THE SOLUTION

### Headline:
```
Connect. Aggregate. Optimize.
```

### Three steps (visual flow):
```
1. CONNECT              2. AGGREGATE            3. OPTIMIZE
   
Cloud APIs to           Individual devices      You set the objective.
1,500+ device types.    become one VPP.         We execute.
No hardware.            Forecast flexibility    Day-ahead. Intraday.
No truck rolls.         by hour, by day.        Balancing. Curtailment.
```

### Bottom callout:
```
You tell the VPP what to do. Our system figures out how.
```

### Designer notes:
- Three cards or columns, numbered
- Dark cards on light background, or light cards on dark
- Process flow feeling (left to right)

---

## SLIDE 6: PROOF

### Headline:
```
1,500+ households. Live in Slovakia.
```

### Big numbers (two columns):
```
1,500+                  10 MWh
households connected    shifted daily
```

### Supporting text:
```
Wattiva deployed its own B2C smart charging app for EV owners 
in Slovakia to prove the platform at scale.

From launch to production: 6 weeks.
Customer complaints about smart charging: zero.
```

### Designer notes:
- Dark background (proof slides feel more credible on dark)
- Numbers large and bold
- "6 weeks" and "zero" should stand out

---

## SLIDE 7: WHAT YOU GET

### Headline:
```
Hedge volatility. Unlock revenue. Reduce churn.
```

### Three value cards:
```
HEDGE                   REVENUE                 RETENTION

Shift load to           Aggregate flexibility   Customers see savings
price valleys.          and bid into markets.   in your app.
Absorb surplus          Day-ahead, intraday,    Switching means
during negative         balancing services.     re-authorizing
hours. Reduce spot      Revenue from assets     everything. In a 15%
exposure.               you don't own.          churn market, that
                                                friction is worth 
                                                millions.
```

### Designer notes:
- Three equal cards
- Each card: bold title + 3-4 lines of text
- Consider color-coding (green for hedge, purple for revenue, amber for retention)

---

## SLIDE 8: WHY NOT BUILD

### Headline:
```
6 weeks vs 18 months.
```

### Two-column comparison:
```
BUILD IN-HOUSE                    DEPLOY WATTIVA

18-24 months to production        6 weeks to production
35% failure rate                  Already proven at 1,500+ households
150-200% cost overrun typical     Zero CAPEX — SaaS model
OEM integrations you maintain     100+ OEMs maintained for you
```

### Bottom line:
```
The build-vs-buy math has changed.
```

### Designer notes:
- Left column: muted/gray styling (the bad option)
- Right column: Wattiva purple (the good option)
- Strong contrast between columns

---

## SLIDE 9: WHY NOW

### Headline:
```
The flexibility market is forming. Now.
```

### Three trends (stacked):
```
DER GROWTH
EU targets by 2030: 215 GW solar, 60M heat pumps, 50M EVs.
These assets will charge and discharge. Randomly or strategically.

FLEXIBILITY DEMAND
220 TWh needed in 2025 → 450 TWh by 2030.
Someone will provide this flexibility.

COMPETITIVE PRESSURE
Octopus built Kraken. Tech-native retailers are capturing share.
The window to catch up is closing.
```

### Designer notes:
- Three horizontal bars or cards, stacked vertically
- Each with accent color on left edge
- Urgency without panic

---

## SLIDE 10: NEXT STEP

### Headline:
```
Your customers own the flexibility.
We help you use it.
```

### CTA:
```
Next step: 30-minute platform demo

We'll show you the optimization engine live.
Real data from our Slovakia deployment.
Scope what a pilot looks like for your customer base.
```

### Button/CTA:
```

```

### Contact:

### Designer notes:
- Dark background (bookend with slide 1)
- CTA button in gradient purple (#8C21F8 → #A958FA)
- Clean, confident, simple

### Designer notes:

- Light background, smaller text acceptable here
